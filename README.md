Multi-User Registration, Login, and Interaction

Make an application that allows users to register new accounts using their name, IP address, and password.

Once registered and logged in, the program should allow you to: choose a recipient; accept or deny incoming messages; send and receive RSA-encrypted messages; and end conversations.

Apply hashing during registration, logins, and message checksums. If checksum fails, inform the user. This activity aims to implement basic password security and tampering detection.

Store user credentials in “users.txt”.

Store messages and hash in “msg.txt”.
